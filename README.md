# StudioManager v 0.5

This is the original conception with Artwork/Edition/Format/Piece structure.

It allows artwork creation, member creation, and disposition of work.

Either stud_m_2019-04-08.sql or stud_m_2019-05-07.sql can be used as the data set. 05-07 started the process of schema change that is used in the v1 system but the changes are minor and the data should work. Still, there were minor changes and 04-08 is recommended.

database should be set to stud_m where the proper tables are installed.
